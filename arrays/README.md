# ARRAYS

## What is an array?
An array is a collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations. The elements of an array can be accessed using an index. The index of the first element of the array is 0, the index of the second element is 1, and so on. The size of an array is fixed and cannot be changed once it is declared.

## Characteristics of an array
- Fixed size: The size of an array is fixed and cannot be changed once it is declared.
- Contiguous memory allocation: The elements of an array are stored in contiguous memory locations.
- Random access: The elements of an array can be accessed using an index.
- Homogeneous elements: An array can store elements of the same data type.
